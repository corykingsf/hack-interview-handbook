- Iterative 1. use parent pointer  2. use iterator
stack --> what kind of nodes maintained in the stack? --> all the nodes with unfinished left subtree

time = O(logn + k)的最优解法 ： 1. 跟binary search在sorted array上找cloest k elements的方法一样，利用iterator的方法


- Follow up:
- Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?
Hint:

 - Consider implement these two helper functions:
    - getPredecessor(N), which returns the next smaller node to N.
     - getSuccessor(N), which returns the next larger node to N.
    - Try to assume that each node has a parent pointer, it makes the problem much easier.
     - Without parent pointer we just need to keep track of the path from the root to the current node using a stack.
    - You would need two stacks to track the path in finding predecessor and successor node separately.
