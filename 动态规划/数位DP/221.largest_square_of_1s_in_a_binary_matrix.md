how many squares are there in a n*n big square?


1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2+5^2 = O(n^3)


for (i, j) as the top-left corner
    for k as the edge length

正方形有上下左右四个边

for (top row)
    for (bottom row)
        for (left column)

solution 1:  brute force
    三个for循环输出所有的正方形,
        time = O(n^3) * n^2


solution 2: 


M[i][j] represetns the max edge length of the square with (i.j) as the bottom-right corner
