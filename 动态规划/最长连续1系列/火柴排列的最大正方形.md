- 火柴排列的边长最大的正方形
- 这个题目难得是建模

- Determine the largest square surrounded by a bunch of matches (each match is either horizontal or vertical), return the length of the largest square.

- The input is a matrix of points. Each point has one of the following values:

- 0 - there is no match to its right or bottom.

- 1 - there is a match to its right.

- 2 - there is a match to its bottom.

- 3 - there is a match to its right, and a match to its bottom

```
Assumptions

The given matrix is guaranteed to be of size M * N, where M, N >= 0



Examples

{{3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0},

 {2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0},

 {3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},

 {2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},

 {1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}}

This matrix represents the following bunch of matches: 
The largest square has length of 2.

- Analysis
  - Use the same presum technique by defining two direction: 
    - left and top 1. if matrix[i][j] == 1 || matrix[i][j] == 3: 
        - dp[i][j].left = dp[i][j + 1].left + 1; 2. if matrix[i][j] == 2 || matrix[i][j] == 3: dp[i][j].top = dp[i + 1][j].top + 1;

  - Note that it's [i][j + 1] and [i + 1][j], which means we need to make sure the two locations have already populated, so we should going from bottom to top and right to left.
