- 不能用乘除，只能用加减，倍增的思想  
- brute force:每次从被除树中减掉除数，直到减到剩下的数<被除数
  - 优化：二进制的思想(a.k.a.快速幂的思想,倍增的想法)
- 倍增法乘以2在bit里对应的是左移操作


### 题目里说了不能用long类型

The key observation is that the quotient of a division is just the number of times that we can subtract the divisor from the dividend without making it negative.

Suppose dividend = 15 and divisor = 3, 15 - 3 > 0. We now try to subtract more by shifting 3 to the left by 1 bit (6). Since 15 - 6 > 0, shift 6 again to 12. Now 15 - 12 > 0, shift 12 again to 24, which is larger than 15. So we can at most subtract 12 from 15. Since 12 is obtained by shifting 3 to left twice, it is 1 << 2 = 4 times of 3. We add 4 to an answer variable (initialized to be 0). The above process is like 15 = 3 * 4 + 3. We now get part of the quotient (4), with a remaining dividend 3.

Then we repeat the above process by subtracting divisor = 3 from the remaining dividend = 3 and obtain 0. We are done. In this case, no shift happens. We simply add 1 << 0 = 1 to the answer variable.

This is the full algorithm to perform division using bit manipulations. The sign also needs to be taken into consideration. And we still need to handle one overflow case: dividend = INT_MIN and divisor = -1.

```java
    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        if (dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        int a = Math.abs(dividend);
        int b = Math.abs(divisor);
        int sign = (divisor > 0) == (dividend > 0) ? 1 : -1;
        int ret = 0, x = 0;
        
        while (a - b >= 0) {
            for (x = 0; a - (b << x << 1) >= 0; x++);
            
            ret += 1 << x;
            a -= b << x;
        } 
        return ret  * sign;
    }
```





```java
class Solution {
    public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        // if (A == 1 << 31 && B == -1) return (1 << 31) - 1;
        if (dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1) {
            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        
        int a = Math.abs(dividend);
        int b = Math.abs(divisor);
        int ret = 0, x = 0;
        
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            if ((a >>> i) - b >= 0) {
                ret += 1 << i;
                a -= (b << i);
            }
        }
        return (dividend > 0) == (divisor > 0) ? ret : -ret;
    }
}
