Solution: 先bucket sort，再累加各bucket值，直到>= 95%。为了更快，可以从尾开始累加，直到>= 5%。注意i--和--i的不同导致结果相差1

```

```
Given a list of integers representing the lengths of urls, find the 95 percentile of all lengths (95% of the urls have lengths <= returned length).

Assumptions

The maximum length of valid url is 4096

The list is not null and is not empty and does not contain null

Examples

[1, 2, 3, ..., 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100], 95 percentile of all lengths is 95.
```


- url太多了，没法都存下来，怎么拿出95 percentile? 
    - 95 percentiel = the minimum L such that the number of URLs that are no longer than L take up at least 95%
    - step 1: iterate over all urls and count the frequency of each url's length
      - length = 0 1 2                128
    - step 2; from left to right for each index, we sum over all numbers until the sum >= 95%, then return this i as the length

```java

public class Solution {
  public int percentile95(List<Integer> lengths) {
    // Write your solution here.
    long[] bucket = new long[4097]; //我只care url的长度，最长的url也不会超过4096, bucket[i]表示长度为i的url有多少个
    for (int len : lengths) {
      bucket[len]++;
    }
    int sum = 0;
    int len = 4097;  // from right to left
    while (sum <= 0.05 * lengths.size()) {
      sum += bucket[--len];
    }
    return len;
  }
}

- follow up: what if we don't know the data type (say general string) of the logs.

    - step 1: do the sampling to understand the basic distrubiton of the data
      - say after the sampling we know that
        - [0-99] [100-199] [200-500][501-1000]
        -    5%     20%      1%       70%
    - step 2: [0-99]  [100-100] [200-500][501-1000]
    -    bucket [0]     [1]      [2]
